# NobleFates-QuickerReroll
The most basic of time-saving

All this does is skip a few more lines of dialogue when re-rolling. You'll still get the transitional black screens. I don't really know how to get rid of that yet, but maybe one day I'll put the effort into figuring it out.

Download this as a zip (under the Code option above right). Then unzip it and place the whole thing in your Mods folder: C:\Users[name]\AppData\LocalLow\Xobermon, LLC\Noble Fates\Mods . You may not have a Mods folder there; if so, add it! (instructions shamelessly stolen from nathanhinchey)

When you're done, it should look like this: C:\Users[name]\AppData\LocalLow\Xobermon, LLC\Noble Fates\Mods\NobleFates-QuickerReroll-main

Feel free to rename the folder after placing it.
